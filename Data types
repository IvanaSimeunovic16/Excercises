# 1.  BRAC2 mRNA: Visit the Web page
#  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/224004157?report=genbank
#  containing a partial coding mRNA sequence of the breast cancer gene BRAC2. You can read more about this gene at https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/BRCA2
#  Observe that the first 60 nucleotides of this gene are:
#  gggtgcgacg attcattgtt ttcggacaag tggataggca accactaccg gtggattgtc
#  Create a Python program that stores this sequence without the blank spaces in a string and prints out the string in lower case and also in upper case letters.

BRAC2_gene_first_nucleotides = "gggtgcgacg attcattgtt ttcggacaag tggataggca accactaccg gtggattgtc"

BRAC2 = BRAC2_gene_first_nucleotides.replace(" ", "")
print(BRAC2.upper())

# 2. List of codons for acidic acids: Create a list variable that holds the DNA codons for Glutamic acid. Next, add to this list the DNA codons that code for Aspartic acid.
#    Your new list now should hold all the DNA codons for acidic acids. 
#    Print the codons for acidic acids, one per line. You will need to look up the necessary codons in a DNA codon table.

codons = ['CAA', 'CAG']
codons.append('GAU')
codons.append('GAC')
print(codons)

# 3. Sorting a list of strings: Sorting entries of a list is a common task. 
#    Modify your Python code in the previous problem so that your code prints out the codons sorted lexically.

codons = ['CAA', 'CAG']
codons.append('GAU')
codons.append('GAC')
print(codons)
sorted_codons = sorted(codons)
print(sorted_codons)

# 4. Dictionary of codons for acidic acids: Create a dictionary variable using the RNA codons that codes for acidic amino acids from previous assignment as keys and the names of the acidic acids as values: (key, value) are (codon, amino acid). Extract the keys list of your dictionary and print it.
#    Extract the values list of your dictionary and print it. You will need to look up for the necessary codons in a RNA codon table.

amino = dict()
amino['CAA'] = 'Glutamine'
amino['CAG'] = 'Glutamine'
amino['GAU'] ='Aspartic_acid'
amino['GAC'] = 'Aspartic_acid'
print(amino)

values = amino.values()
values_list = list(values)
print(values_list)

keys_from_dict = amino.keys()
list_of_keys = list(keys_from_dict)
print(list_of_keys)
