# Write a program that will create a FASTA file for the following three sequences â€“ make sure that all sequences are in upper case and only contain the bases A, T, G and C.
Sequences are:
ABC123 ATCGTACGATCGATCGATCGCTAGACGTATCG
DEF456 actgatcgacgatcgatcgatcacgact
HIJ789 ACTGAC-ACTGT--ACTGTA----CATGTG

a = ">ABC123 \nATCGTACGATCGATCGATCGCTAGACGTATCG"
b = ">DEF456 \nactgatcgacgatcgatcgatcacgact"
c = ">HIJ789 \nACTGAC-ACTGT--ACTGTA----CATGTG"

fasta_file = open("fasta.txt", "a")
fasta_file.write(a)
fasta_file.write("\n")
fasta_file.write(b.upper())
fasta_file.write("\n")
fasta_file.write(c.replace("-", ""))

fasta_file.close()
