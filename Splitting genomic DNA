# Look in the chapter_3 folder for a file called genomic_dna.txt â€“ it contains the same piece of genomic DNA that we were using in the final exercise from chapter 2. Write
a program that will split the genomic DNA into coding and non-coding parts, andwrite these sequences to two separate files.

my_file = open("C:\\exercises\\reading_files\\exercises\\genomic_dna.txt)
my_file_contents = my_file.read()

first_exon = dna_seq[0:62]
intron = dna_seq[62:90]
second_exon = dna_seq[90:]
